# FooBarChalenge
Approach for the Foo Bar Challenge

**Instructions:**
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Foo". For multiples of 5 print "Bar". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FooBar".

But here's the catch: **you can use only one if**. No multiple branches, ternary operators or else.

**Requirements:**
- 1 if
- You can't use else, else if or ternary
